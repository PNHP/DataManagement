    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question the Survey123 team has received from organization administrators is, \"What's the best way to clone my surveys from one organization to another?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two common use cases for cloning surveys:\n",
    "1. Create a copy of a survey in another ArcGIS organization. For example, a city's transportation and water departments have different ArcGIS Online organizations and the water department would benefit from having a copy of one of the transportation department's surveys as well as its associated web map and dashboard.\n",
    "2. Clone a survey from a development organization in ArcGIS Enterprise to staging and production organizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sample Python notebook demonstrates how to clone surveys and associated content from one organization to another. This workflow can be used to clone surveys from ArcGIS Online to ArcGIS Online, ArcGIS Online to ArcGIS Enterprise, or ArcGIS Enterprise to ArcGIS Enterprise. The direction of cloning does not matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates two cloning methods:\n",
    "* <a href='#related-items'>Clone related items</a>\n",
    "* <a href='#full-folder'>Clone survey folder</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "The foundation of the workflow is the <a href='https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.gis.toc.html#arcgis.gis.ContentManager.clone_items' target=_blank>`clone_items()`</a> method in the ArcGIS API for Python. This is the infrastructure that allows us to clone surveys from a source organization to a target organization. Given the different content and item types, possible ArcGIS Enterprise and ArcGIS Online configurations, security considerations, and item dependencies, the `clone_items()` method aims to produce an exact duplicate of an item that retains all of its functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that cloning relies on the sharing model to determine the items a user can clone. The user specified in the source organization will need admin access to the content that will be cloned, and the user specified in the target organization will need the ability to create content in that organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on the `clone_items` method, see the ArcGIS API for Python <a href=\"https://developers.arcgis.com/python/guide/cloning-content/\" target=\"_blank\">Cloning content guide</a> and <a href=\"https://developers.arcgis.com/python/api-reference/arcgis.gis.toc.html?#arcgis.gis.ContentManager.clone_items\" target=\"_blank\">API reference</a>.

A survey in the Survey Manager is a single instance of a survey project that contains the item information and properties and provides access to the underlying survey dataset. In this example, four surveys are shared to a group. Using the group ID, a connection is made to the group and a list is created containing all form items in the group."
