SITE DESCRIPTION
Boggy wetland complex in a saddle on the north side of Peters Mountain, supporting a suite of uncommon and more northern-ranging species.

SURVEY TYPE
Qualitative - We visited to look more thoroughly for Scirpus ancistrochaetus and to visit the pod-grass opening, which I had not seen on my first visit.

THREATS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Succession is likely the greatest threat to some of the rarer species / communities here.  Some management that delicately maintains a patchwork of canopy openness across the site would be beneficial.  The pod grass opening is threatened by herbaceous encroachment, though I'm not sure what an appropriate strategy for addressing that would be.
